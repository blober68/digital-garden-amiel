title: Your first seed

### Welcome!

This is your first note. You'll find it in the [`notes/`](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/tree/master/_notes) directory. 

### Link syntax

To link to another note, you can use multiple syntaxes. The following four use the "double-bracket" notation ([view the Markdown source file](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/master/_notes/your-first-note.md#link-syntax) to see the underlying syntax).

- Using the note title: [[a note about cats]]
- Using the note's filename: [[cats]]
- Using the note's title, with a label: [[A note about cats|link to the note about cats using the note title]]
- Using the note's filename, with a label: [[cats|link to the note about cats using the note's filename]]

You can organize notes in subdirectories and link them normally. For example, the links above all point to the `_notes/animals/cats.md` file. Here's another example: [[tigers]].

Non-latin languages are supported: [[structure]]; so are accents/diacritics: [[bon app√©tit!]]

Dashes and underscores in file names are supported, and may be omitted in the bracket link syntax. As an example, the `your-first-note.md` file can be linked to 

[`structure/`]
